    * added posibility to show background around subtitles
      * dynamic background - dynamically computed background that is as big as subtitles text(default)

   * all search restrictions during search are removed

 * translations
   * slovak translation updated
   * czech translation needs update(feel free to contribute :))

 * improved "UPDATE SEARCH PARAMS" screen:
   * added simple history list of previously searched subtitles, while on title entry(red button)
   * added suggestions list(opensubtitles suggestions), while on title entry(green button)
   * added enable/disable use of video path
     * this option identifies if we want to provide, subtitle's search provider videopath, since some providers can use this path to detect subtitles in sync. This can be used if we want to download subtitles for entirely different video
   * added toggle source title(search expression)(blue button)

 * improved "SUBSSEARCH" screen:
   * no thread counter(top-right corner), since we don't use threads anymore

   * added Save to - we can define where do we want to download subtitles
   * added Append subtitle's language to filename - append/not language to subtitles filename
   * added Always ask for download location - alway ask/not for subtitles download location
   * added Check search params before search - alway open/not open SUBSSEARCHPARAMS screen before subtitles search
     * detecting search parameters from source title(filepath, streampath)is not always reliable, to avoid useless search with wrong parameters is this option enabled by default, so you can see how detection worked and you can correct it before actual search
   * removed search restriction options
   * renamed some options for better clarification
